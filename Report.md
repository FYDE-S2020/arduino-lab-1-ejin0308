## Questions

1. Why does your program need a setup and a loop?

    A program needs a setup to initialize the variables and functions to run the program more efficiently and orderly. A program needs a loop so that I don't have to repeat writing the same code many times and to make the code shorter so that it runs faster. 

2. What is the downside to putting all your code in a loop?

    The downside of putting all my code in a loop is that the program will run infinitely, unable to get out of the loop.  

3. Why does your code need to be compiled?

    My code needs to be complied so that the computer understands what I'm writing to do what I command to do. 

4. When lowering the frequency in procedure A, step 4, what is going wrong? Brainstorm some solutions. Dimmers exist in the real world. What is their solution?

    When lowering the frequency, it doesn't dim like it should be. 

5. Why do you need to connect the logic analyzer ground to the ESP32 ground?

    So that it completes the circuit. 

6. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication?

   In synchronous communication, data is sent in forms of blocks or frames and the transmission is full duplex type. It is more efficient and reliable to use synchronous communication to transfer large amount of data. In asynchronous communication, data is sent in form of byte or character, and the transmission is half duplex type.

8. Profile of SPI: Sent X bytes in Y time

9. Why is SPI so much faster than UART?

    It is much faster because of its simple protocol. While data/clock lines are shared between devices, each device require a unique address wire.

10. list one pro and one con of UART

    UART is simple to use, but slowest in speed. 

11. list one pro and one con of SPI

    SPI is fastest, but complex as device increases. 

12. list one pro and one con of I2C

    ISC is easy to chain many devices, but requires more space as the resistors consume valuable PCB real state. 

13. Why does I2C need external resistors to work?

    Because they consume valuable PCB real state.
